# trumanshow-browser
A tool that generates Web traffic using virtual Web user threads that randomly browse a given list of Web sites.

## Files ##
**README.md:** This file

**browser.py:** A class (Browser) that defines a virtual Web user

**test_browser.py:** The driver script

**urls.txt:** A sample file containing a list of URLs to be visited by Browser threads

## Installation ##

The Browser class defined in browser.py requires the third-party Requests library (http://docs.python-requests.org). On Ubuntu 14.04, this library can be installed via APT:

```sudo apt-get install python3-requests```

Otherwise, it is only necessary to copy the two Python scripts to a convenient location on the machine(s) that will serve as platform for the browsers.

## Configuration and Use ##

Before running the test_browser.py script, it is necessary to specify a list of URLs to be browsed by the agents. Two possibilities are provided for. The list can be supplied in a local file named urls.txt, containing one URL per line. (An example urls.txt file is provided.) Alternatively, a list of URLs can be specified as a commandline argument at run time:

```python3 test_browser.py 'betaport.26maidenlane.net' 'betabank.26maidenlane.net' 'tncc.26maidenlane.net' 'pots.26maidenlane.net' 'gh.26maidenlane.net' 'pha.26maidenlane.net' 'dantes.26maidenlane.net' 'cfa.26maidenlane.net' 'wbpr.26maidenlane.net'```

The number of agent threads may also be specified at run time with the optional -n argument. The default number of agent threads is 10. To run the script with 25 agent threads, for example, with the list of URLs to be visited given in the urls.txt file:

```python3 test_browser.py -n 25```
